        to production-ready applications.[5]\nIntegrations[edit]\nAs of March 2023,
        LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and
        Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information, and
        weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
        of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot

        document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\nHistory[edit]\nLangChain
        was launched in October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase,
        while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023,
        LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in
        funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia
        Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\n
        The project quickly garnered popularity, with improvements from hundreds of
        contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on
        the project''s Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San
        Francisco and London. As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document

      \"content\": \"In October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment
      tool designed to facilitate the transition from LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
      prototypes to production-ready applications.[5]\\nIntegrations[edit]\\nAs of
      March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google,
      and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information,
      and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
      of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning
      prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \\\"todo\\\" tasks in code;
      Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction,
      and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI, Anthropic,
      and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and
      summarization; MapReduce for question answering, combining documents, and question
      generation; N-gram overlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf for PDF
      file text extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation,
      analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database[6] to store and retrieve vector
      embeddings; Weaviate vector database[7] to cache embedding and data objects;
      Redis cache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API

      for logging; text mapping for k-nearest neighbors search; time zone conversion
      and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols in threaded and
      asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha website and SDK.[8] As a
      language model integration framework, LangChain''s use-cases largely overlap
      with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization,
      chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\\nHistory[edit]\\nLangChain was launched in
      October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine
      learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated
      and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at
      least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing
      a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n The project quickly garnered
      popularity, with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending
      discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project''s Discord server, many
      YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. As of April 2023,
      it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[9]\\nReferences[edit]\\nExternal

      \"content\": \"In October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment
      tool designed to facilitate the transition from LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
      prototypes to production-ready applications.[5]\\nIntegrations[edit]\\nAs of
      March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google,
      and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information,
      and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution
      of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning
      prompt generation support; finding and summarizing \\\"todo\\\" tasks in code;
      Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction,
      and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI, Anthropic,
      and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and
      summarization; MapReduce for question answering, combining documents, and question
      generation; N-gram overlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf for PDF
      file text extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation,
      analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database[6] to store and retrieve vector
      embeddings; Weaviate vector database[7] to cache embedding and data objects;
      Redis cache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API

      for logging; text mapping for k-nearest neighbors search; time zone conversion
      and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols in threaded and
      asynchronous subprocess runs; and the Wolfram Alpha website and SDK.[8] As a
      language model integration framework, LangChain''s use-cases largely overlap
      with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization,
      chatbots, and code analysis.[2]\\nHistory[edit]\\nLangChain was launched in
      October 2022 as an open source project by Harrison Chase, while working at machine
      learning startup Robust Intelligence. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated
      and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at
      least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing
      a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n The project quickly garnered
      popularity, with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending
      discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project''s Discord server, many
      YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. As of April 2023,
      it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[9]\\nReferences[edit]\\nExternal

This template showcases a [ReAct agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) implemented using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), designed for [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio). ReAct agents are uncomplicated, prototypical agents that can be flexibly extended to many tools.

![Graph view in LangGraph studio UI](./static/studio_ui.png)

The core logic, defined in `src/react_agent/graph.py`, demonstrates a flexible ReAct agent that iteratively reasons about user queries and executes actions, showcasing the power of this approach for complex problem-solving tasks.

## What it does

The ReAct agent:

1. Takes a user **query** as input
2. Reasons about the query and decides on an action
3. Executes the chosen action using available tools
4. Observes the result of the action
5. Repeats steps 2-4 until it can provide a final answer

By default, it's set up with a basic set of tools, but can be easily extended with custom tools to suit various use cases.

## Getting Started

Assuming you have already [installed LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#download), to set up:

1. Create a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Define required API keys in your `.env` file.

The primary [search tool](./src/react_agent/tools.py) [^1] used is [Tavily](https://tavily.com/). Create an API key [here](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in).

<!--
Setup instruction auto-generated by `langgraph template lock`. DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY.
-->

### Setup Model

The defaults values for `model` are shown below:

```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
```

Follow the instructions below to get set up, or pick one of the additional options.

#### Anthropic

To use Anthropic's chat models:

1. Sign up for an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Once you have your API key, add it to your `.env` file:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
#### OpenAI

To use OpenAI's chat models:

1. Sign up for an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. Once you have your API key, add it to your `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```





<!--
End setup instructions
-->


3. Customize whatever you'd like in the code.
4. Open the folder LangGraph Studio!

## How to customize

1. **Add new tools**: Extend the agent's capabilities by adding new tools in [tools.py](./src/react_agent/tools.py). These can be any Python functions that perform specific tasks.
2. **Select a different model**: We default to Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet. You can select a compatible chat model using `provider/model-name` via configuration. Example: `openai/gpt-4-turbo-preview`.
3. **Customize the prompt**: We provide a default system prompt in [prompts.py](./src/react_agent/prompts.py). You can easily update this via configuration in the studio.

You can also quickly extend this template by:

- Modifying the agent's reasoning process in [graph.py](./src/react_agent/graph.py).
- Adjusting the ReAct loop or adding additional steps to the agent's decision-making process.

## Development

While iterating on your graph, you can edit past state and rerun your app from past states to debug specific nodes. Local changes will be automatically applied via hot reload. Try adding an interrupt before the agent calls tools, updating the default system message in `src/react_agent/configuration.py` to take on a persona, or adding additional nodes and edges!

Follow up requests will be appended to the same thread. You can create an entirely new thread, clearing previous history, using the `+` button in the top right.

You can find the latest (under construction) docs on [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) here, including examples and other references. Using those guides can help you pick the right patterns to adapt here for your use case.

LangGraph Studio also integrates with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for more in-depth tracing and collaboration with teammates.
